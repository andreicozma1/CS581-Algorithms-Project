[Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v4WwBQKoPnGiyCMXgUs-pCCJ8IwZqM3thUf-Ky00eTQ/edit?usp=sharing)

Evolution of Reinforcement Learning methods from pure Dynamic Programming-based methods to Monte Carlo methods + Bellman Optimization Comparison  

## Presentation Guide (Text Version)

1. Title Slide: list the title of your talk along with your name  

2. Test Questions Slide: provide three questions relevant to your subject  

- short answers should suffice
- somewhere during your talk provide the answers, but do not emphasize them

3. Presenter’s Slides: let others get to know you  

- provide a little information about yourself, your degree program and your advisor  
- describe your interests and goals; show a map and picture(s) of your hometown
- as examples, students frequently like to mention their pets, their travels, their interests in music and food, even their favorite movies, you name it  

4. Outline Slide: provide a bulleted outline of the rest of your talk  

5. Overview Slide: list important definitions and provide a brief mention of applications  

6. History Slide: discuss major contributors, interesting stories and main developments  

7. Algorithms Slides: describe basic procedures and methodological comparisons  

- this should be the main part of your talk  
- discuss techniques from the most basic to the state-of-the-art  
- use examples and figures whenever possible  

8. Applications Slides: educate the class about amenable problems of interest to you  

- don’t get bogged down in too much minutiae  
- once again use examples and figures whenever possible  

9. Implementations Slides: discuss the results of your coding work (if any)  

- compare and contrast the algorithms you implemented
- make effective use of table and charts

10. Open Issues Slide: enumerate and discuss a few open questions

11. References Slide: provide a handful of key citations

12. Discussion Slide: solicit questions from the class

- this slide may have only a few bullets – it may even be left blank
- this is a good opportunity for other students to add to the discussion
- be ready to prompt some questions if there is silence
- remember not to repeat answers to your test questions

13. Test Questions Slide Revisited: show again your original test questions slide

- students may now complete their answer sheets and hand them to you
- Ashley will supervise as we applaud your excellent presentation!
